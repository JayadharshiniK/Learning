What is JavaScript?

*JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at
 runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any
 machine (host environment);
 //Dynamic, Interpreted programming language:
 **Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled "on the fly" (eg. in the browser)
 **Code evaluated and executed at runtime
 **Code can change at runtime (eg. type of a variable)
// Weakly typed programming language:
** Data types are assumed (eg. assigned to variables) automatically
**You don't define that some variable has to hold a certain value (eg.a number)
** Data types are not set in stone but can change

*Interpreted, "on the fly" compiled language

//How is JavaScript executed?
--when your code want it to have some effect on the web page (i.e. to run the JavaScript code),
we need a JavaScript engine (it's built into the browser)
eg. V8-(CHROME)
SpiderMonkey-(Firefox)

--JavaScript Engine=>> Parse code--> Compile to machine code-->Execute Machine code-->Effect on webpage

*"Hosted language": Runs in different environments (eg. in browser)
*Most prominent use-case: Run code in a browser (on a webpage)

 How do web pages work?

 *You are the user visiting a web page
 *Visit and interact with your machine where the browser installed on it
 *You click on a URL- (initial visit)Request is sent on to the server(where the webpage or html file is stored)
 *The server then ,loads the web page and sends it back to your browser as a 'response'
 //JavaScript simply makes this process more interactive

 Dynamic webpages?
*JavaScript helps to load information on the same web page like pop-up windows &
menus instead of sending another html request for a new page.

JavaScript runs on a host environment
-------------------------------------
**Browser-side:
=>JavaScript can manipulate the HTML code, CSS, send background Http requests & much more
=>It cannot access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system, etc.

**Other eg. Server-side
