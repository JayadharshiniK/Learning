JSON:

JavaScript object notation: a lightweight data-interchange format;
It is easy for humans to read and write;
It is easy for machines to parse and generate;

//JSON object is written inside curly brackets
//JSON array is written inside square brackets

//convert json into Java format
//we represent a list of items in an object, we represent them like array (square bracket)

????how to add key value pair in the JSON object already declared;
#Method1:-

  i.category = "cinema";
  return i
});

#Method2:-
  albums.map(i=>{i["category"] = "cinema"});

let instagram = {
    user1: "id1",
    user2: "id2"
}

let i;

for (i=3; i<=10; i++) {
    let newUser = "user" + i;
    let newId = "id" + i;
    instagram[newUser] = newId;
}
